# Basins of Attraction

In this project we will propose some algorithms to determine basins of attraction of nonlinear dynamic systems. However, we use the julia language to determine the attractors and the basins of attraction, however, for the construction of the graphs we will use the python language. The analysis for the construction of the basins of attraction is using DynamicalSystems.jl.
